# Golang-Demo-Backend

# Go Layered Architecture Back-End API

## Project Overview

This project is a back-end API developed using Go (Golang), structured with a layered architecture. The primary objective is to harness Go's speed, simplicity, and powerful standard library to build a fast and efficient server-side application. The project also integrates GORM for ORM and Echo for routing, providing a robust and scalable solution for back-end operations.

## Project Architecture

### Layered Architecture

The project is organized following the principles of layered architecture, which helps separate concerns and maintain a clean, modular codebase. The application is divided into several layers:

#### Handler (Controller) Layer
- Manages HTTP requests and responses.
- Routes incoming requests to the appropriate service functions using the Echo framework.
- Responsible for input validation and handling errors before sending responses.

#### Service Layer
- Contains the business logic of the application.
- Receives requests from the handler layer, processes them according to business rules, and interacts with the data access layer.
- Decouples the business logic from the data access and HTTP layers.

#### Repository (Data Access) Layer
- Manages database interactions using GORM, an ORM library for Go.
- Handles all CRUD operations with the database and ensures that data is correctly retrieved, updated, and deleted.
- Abstracts the data source, providing a clean API for the service layer to interact with.

#### Model Layer
- Defines the data models (entities) used in the application.
- Structures the data to map to database tables using GORM.
- Provides the foundation for data interaction across the application.

### Go's Advantages

- **Speed:** Go is known for its fast compilation and execution, making it an excellent choice for building high-performance applications. The compiled nature of Go ensures minimal runtime overhead, resulting in quick server responses.
  
- **Simplicity:** Go's syntax is clean and simple, which reduces the complexity of code. This simplicity helps in maintaining code quality and speeding up the development process.
  
- **Powerful Standard Library:** Go provides a comprehensive standard library that covers a wide range of functionalities, from web servers to cryptography, allowing developers to build applications without relying heavily on external dependencies.

### GORM Integration

- **GORM:** GORM is a powerful ORM library for Go that simplifies database interactions. It allows developers to interact with databases using Go structs instead of raw SQL queries, making the code more readable and maintainable.

### Echo Framework

- **Echo:** Echo is a high-performance, extensible web framework for Go. It is designed to be minimal yet powerful, providing features such as routing, middleware support, and request handling, making it an excellent choice for building RESTful APIs.

## API Features

- **Create Resource:** Adds a new resource to the system.
- **Retrieve Resource:** Fetches a list of resources or a specific resource by ID.
- **Update Resource:** Modifies an existing resource.
- **Delete Resource:** Removes a resource from the system.

## Technologies

- **Go (Golang)** - The programming language used for developing the API.
- **Echo** - A fast and minimalistic web framework for routing and handling HTTP requests.
- **GORM** - An ORM library used for interacting with the database.
- **PostgreSQL** - The database used for storing application data.
